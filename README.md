**Project Name: কোডসনধানী (Kod Shondhani)**

**Description:**
কোডসনধানী (Kod Shondhani) is an innovative Python code obfuscator developed in India by a talented Bengali programmer. This powerful tool is designed to enhance code security and protect intellectual property by transforming Python source code into a more complex and challenging-to-read format, without altering its functionality.

**Key Features:**

1. **Code Transformation:** কোডসনধানী uses advanced obfuscation techniques to modify the structure and appearance of Python code, making it difficult for reverse engineers to understand or decipher.

2. **Variable Renaming:** The tool intelligently renames variables, functions, and classes using randomized and non-descriptive names, rendering the code less comprehensible.

3. **Control Flow Obfuscation:** কোডসনধানী alters the control flow of the code, adding conditional statements and loops that do not affect the program's logic but obfuscate its structure.

4. **String Encryption:** String literals are encrypted to protect sensitive information or API keys embedded within the code.

5. **Comment Removal:** All comments and docstrings are removed to eliminate any hints or explanations that could aid reverse engineering.

6. **Whitespace and Formatting Changes:** The tool makes random changes to code formatting, indentation, and whitespace to further obscure the code's structure.

7. **Support for Python Versions:** কোডসনধানী is compatible with multiple versions of Python, ensuring that code obfuscation can be applied to a wide range of projects.

8. **User-Friendly Interface:** The tool provides a simple and intuitive command-line interface for ease of use.

**Use Cases:**

- **Code Protection:** Developers and organizations can use কোডসনধানী to protect their Python applications from unauthorized access and reverse engineering.

- **Intellectual Property Protection:** Companies can safeguard their proprietary algorithms and logic from being copied or stolen.

- **Licensing Control:** কোডসনধানী can be used to enforce licensing restrictions and prevent unauthorized modifications of Python code.

- **Open Source Projects:** Open source projects can use this tool to protect their codebase while still sharing their software with the community.

**Conclusion:**
কোডসনধানী (Kod Shondhani) empowers Python developers, particularly in the Bengali community, to protect their code and intellectual property with an efficient and easy-to-use obfuscation tool. This project is a testament to the talent and innovation emerging from the vibrant programming community in India, particularly among Bengali developers.
